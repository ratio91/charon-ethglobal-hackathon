# Scaling Ethereum  

## History  

Ethereum was launched in 2015 and supports 10-15 tps (transactions per second). This is obviously not enough for a protocol that aims to be the backbone of a global decentralized financial system or even the "world computer". Ever since it was clear, that **Ethereum must evolve to continue to be usable**. Otherwise, **high transaction costs** (in the form of gas fees) will deter users from using it.  

## Ethereum 2.0  

Ethereum 2.0 is a set of protocol upgrades that improve the scalability of Ethereum itself (**layer 1**). This can be achieved by switching the consensus mechanism from Proof-of-Work to a **Proof-of-Stake algorithm** (an event called **"the merge"** - expected end of 2021/early 2022). The **beacon chain**, which represents the new consensus layer is already live since Dec. 2020. Also, **"Sharding"** will improve the storage of data (64 shards instead of 1 chain). This will be implemented at a later stage. [read more here](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/)

## Layer 2  

As the creator of Ethereum himself, Vitalik Buterin, notes - the future of Ethereum is based on rollup technology - also known as **"layer 2"**. [read more here](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698)
Rollup technology broadly can be separated into **optimistic rollups** and **zk-rollups**. Examples for the former are **Optimism** and **Arbitrum**, while an example for the latter is **zkSync**. Other scaling solutions include the plasma-based commit chain **Polygon (formerly Matic)** and the custodial sidechain procotol **SKALE**.  

## Testnet

A testnet is technically the same code as a production network. The difference is that it is usually free to obtain native tokens such as ETH and thus ideally suited for testing. Well-known Ethereum testnet include:

- rinkeby
- ropsten
- kovan
- goerli
