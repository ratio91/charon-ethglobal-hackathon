**Who:**  Alex Gluchowski, who founded Matter Labs ()

**What:**  zkSync is built using Matter Labsâ€™ zkRollup technology

**Where:** Stichting ZK Sync, Netherlands Foundation, Amsterdam, NL / head office is in Berlin

**When:**  In 2019, Matter Labs announced a USD 2 million Series Seed financing round led by Placeholder and joined by 1kx, Dekrypt, Hashed, and Dragonfly Capital Partners.  

**Why:**  To create Ethereum's most advanced ZK rollup.

**How:**  zkPorter account tx data will be sent to Guardians instead of ETH node calldata (only merkle roots instead)

**Strengths:**  security properties of L1, Withdrawals to L1 in under 15 minutes. and EVM compatible rollups!

**Weaknesses:** issues: sucidal attempt of 2/3rd of guardians would be possible (unlikely) --> every user can select security level (%)  for a specific price
